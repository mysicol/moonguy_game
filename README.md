# Moonguy Game

You are stupid if you cannot figure out how to play this game.

also you can run now (press shift)

## Instructions

1. Clone repository.
2. Run `python game.py` in repository root.

this will automatically install pygame on your computer so like go into a venv or whatever if you hate pygame

# Moonguy Game

You are stupid if you cannot figure out how to play this game.

^ is what I would have said before I actually made it be a game. Press 'h' for help.

## Instructions

1. Clone repository.
2. Run `python game.py` in repository root.

this will automatically install pygame on your computer so like go into a venv or whatever if you hate pygame
